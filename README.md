# VueJS and Google Maps

This is a simple integration between Vuejs and Google Maps API

# Clone this project

```
git clone https://github.com/dalenguyen/vuejs-googlemaps.git
```

Remember to change the Google Maps API from *index.html* file.

# Install dependencies

```
npm install
npm install --only=dev
```

# Run this project

Once we add an entry point, we'll be able to build by running

```sh
npm run build
```

and have builds get triggered on changes by running

```sh
npm run build -- --watch
```

Now you can go to your folder and open the *index.html* file.
